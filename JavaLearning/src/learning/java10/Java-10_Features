1.	Local variable Type Inference:
	Its limited only to Local Variables with Initializer, Indexes of enhanced
	for loop or indexes, Local declared in for loop. Example:
		// Local variable with Initializer
		var numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // inferred value ArrayList<String>
		// Index of Enhanced For Loop
		for (var number : numbers) {
			System.out.println(number);
		}
		// Local variable declared in a loop
		for (var i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
			System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
		}

2.	Experimental Java based JIT Compiler(Graal) on the Linux/x64 Platform

3.	Application Class Data Sharing

4.	Parallel full GC for G1 Garbage Collector.

5.	Garbage Collector Interface

6.	Additional Unicode Language Tag Expression

7.	Root Certificates

8.	Thread Local Handshakes

9.	Heap Allocations on alternative Memory Devices

10.	Remove the Native-Header Generation Tool - javah

11.	Consolidate the JDK Forest into a Single Repository

12.	Added APIs:
	* List, Set and Map Interfaces are added with a static copyOf() method that
	  returns an unmodifiable Collection.
	* Optional & its primitive variations get a method orElseThrow(). This is
	  exactly same as get(), however the java doc states that it is a preferred
	  alternative then get().
	* Collectors class gets various methods for collecting unmodifiable
	  collections (Set, List, Map).
